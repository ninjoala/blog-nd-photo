# Photographing the Boyds

Today was a special day, because I was able to photograph Christmas cards and family photos for some dear friends of ours.

Those friends are of course, Josh and Rachael Boyd (AKA the JRB Dream Team). I met them through my wife who works with the school system, as does Josh and until recently, his wife Rachael.

In the recent years, Josh and Rachael's lives have drastically shifted as they welcomed a new baby into their family. Where there were once plans of retirement and relaxation, now there are plans of arranging pickup times from school, and planning out dinner every night for a family of 5.

With these changes in their life, Josh and Rachael decided to take a risk and pivot to Real Estate, both as agents and investors.

Around the same time that Rachael and Josh were having their child, my wife and I found out we were pregnant, and I was told by my father (an avid photographer) that I needed to pick up a camera and learn how to use it.

Something tells me he just wanted pictures of his grandchild... but I digress.

Pick up a camera I did, and pivot to Real Estate Josh and Rachael did.

Josh and Rachael were some of my first ever customers, and it always meant the world to me that they were willing to trust me so much as to allow me to take their Christmas photos last year; especially since I had only been taking photos for around 6 months at the time.

Now, a year and a half later after picking up a camera for the first time, and 11 months after having our first child, I put _my_ trust in Josh and Rachael to guide my wife and I through the process of buying our first home.

And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. From showing houses, all the way to being handed the keys, Rachael and Josh were with us every step of the way.

They were our greatest advocates, our coach in the corner of the ring, and they were our guiding hand.

With every question I had, (and I had many) and with every step I took, I always knew I could reach out and I would receive guidance and patience in return. They made the process so easy!

I could not have asked for a more seamless process and I cannot recommend them enough.

I only hope I can repay them in kind with these photos.. and man, they were so much fun to photograph.
