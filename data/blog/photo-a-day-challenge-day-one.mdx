# A Photo a Day

It's definitely been the case that I've let my social media fall to the wayside. Last year has brought many changes, and maintaining my social media pages for my business has not /n/n
been at the top of my priority list.

If you've ever been in charge of social media for yourself, or anyone else, you probably know the feeling. Every now and then the thought "Man, I really need to post something" crosses my mind.

And once that thought crosses my mind, I often find myself dreading the fact that social media is even an important part of my business in the first place. But it's 2025 now. And social media, internet presence, and public visibility are number 1 if you're trying to make it as a business owner.

With these thoughts in mind, when my father approached me earlier this week saying that we should post a photo every day, it dawned on me that this could be a great way to increase my online visibility.

So, I will define the rules of this self-imposed challege here:

- I will take a photo every day of the year
- I will post a photo on social media every day, although this can be done retroactively.
  - This means I don't necessarily have to post the photo the day I took it, as long as it is posted.

And I think that's it!

These rules might change over time, and this blog will be an opportunity to explore my thoughts on the challenge.

# Today's Photo

Today is New Year's Day, Jan 1, 2025. I decided to take my 100mm macro lens outside and photograph some moss. Something I haven't done a lot is macro photography, and I think utilizing the limitless compsitional possibilities of the macro microscape will be an invaluable tool in keeping my photography interesting and dynamic.

As I was photographing the moss, I spent a lot of time sitting in one spot, surveying the tiny landscape around me, when I found a leaf that was making an interesting shape, backlit by the sun. That's really it, it's a leaf that I thought looked cool. It might even be 'artful'.

All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with how it has turned out.

P.S., if you're reading this Dad, this is me formally and publicly challenging you to take part in the photo a day challenge.
